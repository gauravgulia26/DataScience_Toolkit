    "### **Scenario: Enhanced Library Management System with Error Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "A library management system needs to handle books, borrowers, and transactions, ensuring smooth operations with error handling for edge cases. The system should implement the following functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Book Management**:\n",
    "   - Add new books to the library.\n",
    "   - Prevent duplicate entries by checking ISBN.\n",
    "   - Raise an error if attempting to remove a book not in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Borrower Registration**:\n",
    "   - Add new borrowers with unique IDs.\n",
    "   - Prevent duplicate borrower registration.\n",
    "   - Raise an error if an unregistered borrower tries to borrow a book.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Borrowing Process**:\n",
    "   - Allow borrowers to borrow available books.\n",
    "   - Raise an error if the book is already borrowed or doesn't exist in the library.\n",
    "   - Enforce borrowing limits per borrower (e.g., maximum of 5 books).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return Process**:\n",
    "   - Update the system when borrowers return books.\n",
    "   - Raise an error if a borrower tries to return a book they havenâ€™t borrowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Availability Checks**:\n",
    "   - Provide a mechanism to check the availability of books.\n",
    "   - Raise an error if the queried book is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Borrower History**:\n",
    "   - Maintain a record of books borrowed and returned.\n",
    "   - Ensure history is updated correctly for each transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - Use exceptions to manage errors such as duplicate entries, borrowing limits, and invalid operations.\n",
    "   - Provide user-friendly messages for all errors to guide the operator of the system.\n",
